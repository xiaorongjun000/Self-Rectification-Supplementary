# Supplemental Material to Generating Non-Stationary Textures using Self-Rectification

This supplementary material mainly specifies the pseudocode of the algorithm mentioned in the paper and shows more additional results. 

## 1. Algorithm pseudocode

Here is the link to pseudocode of the algorithm mentioned in the paper:

## 2. More texture synthesis results

## 3. More homogeneous textures  synthesis results

There are to configuration for homogeneous texture synthesis:

**Config.1** We reshuffle the **source/reference textures** as target before applying self-rectification.

**Config.2** Reshuffle the **latent code** after the inversion inversion in the first self-rectification.

## 6. S1S2-para space explore, P1=P2=0

Firstly, we set P1=0, P2=0 and explore the S1S2-para space. Here is the link to the result.

## 7. P1P2-para space explore, S1=20, S2=5

We set S1=20, S2=5, explore P1 and P2 settings.
